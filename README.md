A photovoltaic car chelter produces electricity, you can use this electricity for whatever you want, loading the batteries of your EV car or using an electric washing machine to wash your clothes.
At a 45° latitude North, a 20 m² place shelter produce enough electricity (3000 kwh/year) to run 10,000 km per year with a Prius (requires 300W/km).

In countries like France or Canada, it makes more sense to connect it to the grid to use 100 % of the produced electricity in the grid, if your car is connected, the electricity will go in the car battery, because it is the closest sink, if your car is not connected, it will be used by the closest user. Until solar energy provides 35 % of our needs, it is immediately used by the grid, no needs for storage.

For the 5 years I have been working on this shelter, I have learn the best process  to market and build it. Today, I want to make this process open-source. So that Sensoricans or other member of a shared value network can build as many shelters as possible.

You need some marketing documents and you need a client. The prototype, which represent 2 years of work and 200,000 € investment is already built and running here in Le-Bourget-du-Lac. We have built another one in Grenoble.

Let suppose that a company or a University wants to install a 24 place shelter on the park of its headquarter, the cost will be around 240,000 € ( VAT not included). Sensorica has to request a first payment of 40,000 € that will pay the preliminary studies and the management of the project.

Installing such a shelter is a rather long process, (18 months to 2 years) it includes the following steps:

	
* Designing the size of the foundations, such as the building can resist the local conditions: snow, wind, earthquake, hurricanes…This work is made by a local civil  engineering office. You give the pictures or the map of the shelter and they 3D it and compute the size of the foundations. In Le-Bourget-du-Lac the shelter can resist a 140 km/h wind AND a 30 cm of snow. (1 month)

* Building permit, in France you have to ask the building permit to the local 	administrative office of the townhall. (up to 2 months)

* Building the foundations, following the engineering office, this should be made by a local building company. It requires a small excavator and reinforced concrete. (3 weeks). You cannot build on the concrete before 3 weeks.

* The wood structure: use a local factory experiences in wood structure.
 
* Solar panels can be installed by any electrical company as they would put it on a regular roof. Of course, the solar panels are not open-source.

We can include technologies from [the Matrioshka project](http://www.sensorica.co/home/what-we-do/projects/matrioshka-project) to increase the potential of this design.
